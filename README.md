## ⚠️ Note on Repositories

These are **university projects**, created as part of coursework. As such:

- Some repositories may not have **perfect Git commit messages**.  
- Documentation may be limited or incomplete in certain projects.  
- The main goal was to **demonstrate learning through building projects**.
